miniProject containing the following Team <br/>
- Jayson Baldemor <br/>
- Emi Herdman <br/>
- Rahman Bari <br/>

Some issues to note, when proj installed you need to manually bring the scene into the Hierarchy, perhaps it's because I (Emi never built it lol)<br/>

TODO <br/>
- Add collisions <br/>
- finish levels <br/>
- clean up code with vars etc <br/>
